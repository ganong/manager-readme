# A Guide to Working with Me

Welcome!

This exists to give you some insight into what to expect when working with me. This is **not** my expectations of you. Most of this will come out organically as we get to know each other. This serves as a place for me to gather my thoughts and share them succinctly (or as succinctly as possible...).

## My Role

In short, my role is to: maintain and elevate team culture, have deep domain/technical knowledge of my team's products, hold my team accountable, and keep my eyes on the horizon.

### Maintain and Elevate Team Culture

### Have Deep Domain/Technical Knowledge

### Hold my Team Accountable

### Keep my Eyes on the Horizon

I'm a firm believer that work is a function of people and environment. Therefore, my main job is to make sure the team has the "right" people (more on this in a bit) and an environment that supports them to do great work.

Who's the "right" person for a team? In short, an [ideal team player](https://www.tablegroup.com/books/ideal-team-player) is what I mean by "right" - that's someone that's humble, hungry, and smart (EQ).

## My Beliefs

### Team Ownership

## Empowerment

### Servant Leadership

### Real People

- It's easier to be kind to one another when we know we're all real, live humans. Sounds simple right? Well, when we're just a name behind an email address or slack handle, it's pretty easy to forget that there's actually a person behind that name. Spending time getting to know one another not only helps with this but can also improve communication in everyday work as you will learn each person's personal communication style.
- Whether you intend to or not, everyone brings non-work "stuff" to work, and that's perfectly normal and expected. If you didn't, you'd be a robot. So, if you have any non-work "stuff" that's affecting your work, please let me know. You don't have to share the details, but simply saying something like, "I've got some personal things going on that are making me grumpy today." helps me to know it's not me, a coworker, or your current project making you grumpy (if it is a coworker or current project, please do share those details!). Likewise, let myself and the team help celebrate your non-work wins as well!

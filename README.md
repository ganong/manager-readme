# A Guide to Working with Me

Welcome!

This exists to give you some insight into what to expect when working with me. This is **not** my expectations of you. Most of this will come out organically as we get to know each other. This serves as a place for me to gather my thoughts and share them succinctly (or as succinctly as possible...).

## My Role

In short, my role is to maintain and elevate team culture and to have deep domain/technical knowledge of my team's products in order to hold my team accountable, keep my eyes on the horizon, and advise on technical feasibility of new features/products.

### Maintain and Elevate Team Culture

I'm a firm believer that work is a function of people and environment. Therefore, my main job is to make sure the team has the "right" people and an environment that supports them to do great work.

Who's the "right" person for a team? In short, an [ideal team player](https://www.tablegroup.com/books/ideal-team-player) is what I mean by "right" - that's someone that's humble, hungry, and smart (EQ). I'll take an ideal team player without relevant experience over a non-ideal team player with relevant experience any day of the week. The hunger alone, will help that ideal team player bridge the gap in short order, elevating the team. Whereas the non-ideal team player may be able to hit the ground running but will bring down the rest of the team over time. Another way to put this - no brilliant jerks please!

The work environment is primarily made up of a set of behaviors, and culture is the byproduct of the behaviors you tolerate. Therefore, I work to discourage negative behaviors such as gossip and to encourage positive behaviors such as public praise.

A quick note on gossip: you should pass negatives up and positives all around. Sharing positive comments with coworkers helps foster more positivity. Sharing negative comments with coworkers will help foster more negativity, and, furthermore, generally your coworkers can't help resolve the conflicts. For instance, if you have a problem with your computer, chances are your coworker you're complaining to won't be able to help, but if you let your manager know about your issue, he/she can (and is motivated to) work to resolve the issue.

### Have Deep Domain/Technical Knowledge

This one is pretty obvious as it facilitates many of my responsibilities. I need to have deep domain knowledge in order to hold my team accountable, set the direction, or advise on technical feasibility of new features/products.

#### Hold my Team Accountable

I'm a fan of using OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) to accomplish this. They help us to set goals and evaluate our progress and success. [This](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/) is a good introduction to OKRs.

#### Keep my Eyes on the Horizon

As the team's "heads down" on new features and daily deliverables, I work to keep my head up to see what's coming and make sure we're heading in the right direction. Sometimes I'll run out ahead to scout the area to see which way we should go.

This doesn't mean I won't involve the team in direction. In fact it's quite the opposite. I seek feedback, suggestions, and ideas from everyone on the team.

#### Advise on Technical Feasibility

While working with stakeholders, it's imperative for me to know if a suggestion or new feature request is technically feasible or not. Likewise, if there's a question on how something works technically, I should be able to explain it in low level (or close to low level) detail. This keeps me from having to include an engineer in all stakeholder and business meetings.

Similar to "Keep my Eyes on the Horizon", this doesn't mean I won't involve the team in stakeholder and business meetings. I believe in giving engineers opportunities to get in front of stakeholders. You have to find the right balance of meetings to development time to maximize productivity.

### We're All Real People (Not Robots)

It's easier to be kind to one another when we know we're all real, live humans. Sounds simple right? Well, when we're just a name behind an email address or slack handle, it's pretty easy to forget that there's actually a person behind that name. Spending time getting to know one another not only helps with this but can also improve communication in everyday work as you will learn each person's personal communication style.

Whether you intend to or not, everyone brings non-work "stuff" to work, and that's perfectly normal and expected. If you didn't, you'd be a robot. So, if you have any non-work "stuff" that's affecting your work, please let me know. You don't have to share the details, but simply saying something like, "I've got some personal things going on that are making me grumpy today." helps me to know it's not me, a coworker, or your current project making you grumpy (if it is a coworker or current project, please do share those details!). Likewise, let myself and the team help celebrate your non-work wins as well!

## What to Expect from Me

### Availability

I will always make myself available if you need something. Feel free to slack, email, text, or call (in that order). Likewise, I will generally slack you for anything relatively immediate. If it's anything that's not urgent, or it's after hours, I'll most likely email you.

If it's after hours, and it's urgent, I'll start with a slack and escalate to text/call if necessary. Generally speaking, this shouldn't happen, and you shouldn't feel the need to respond after hours or on weekends. Usually if I have a question for you after hours, I'll set a reminder to ask you about it during the next business day.

### Feedback - Open/Transparent

I do my best to live as an open book. If you ask me about something even if it's personal, I'll probably answer it.

That said, anything you and I discuss in private will stay there unless I have your permission to share it. Likewise, there may be some company information I may not be able to share. Typically, it's more of a timing thing - I can't share it until X date. In these cases, I'll say so.

I'm a big believer in being radically candid - from Radical Candor by Kim Scott. Here's a great [article](https://firstround.com/review/radical-candor-the-surprising-secret-to-being-a-good-boss/) on First Round Review that sums it up.
